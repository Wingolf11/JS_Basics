# Basic JavaScript Exercises

This project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts through a series of small, focused exercises. It is intended for beginners who want to understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how basic logic works in the browser.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The exercises are organized into sections and displayed in a single HTML page. Each section targets a specific JavaScript concept and shows output either directly in the browser or in the developer console.

## ðŸ”¹ Sections Covered

### Arrays
This section demonstrates how to loop through an array and perform operations on each element. It helps practice basic iteration and manipulation of data structures.

### Variables and Arithmetic
Covers variable declarations and arithmetic operations. The results (sum, difference, product, quotient) are calculated using simple numeric values and displayed dynamically in the HTML.

### Functions
Shows how to define and use functions in JavaScript. A simple average function is created to demonstrate input parameters, return values, and updating the DOM with results.

### Conditionals
Introduces `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements. This exercise checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero and displays the corresponding message.
